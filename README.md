# Iris Dataset Analysis with Decision Trees
This repository contains code to analyze the Iris dataset using a Decision Tree classifier. The code includes data preprocessing, model creation, evaluation, visualization of the decision tree, and making predictions on new samples.

# Introduction
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of three different species of iris flowers, each represented by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. In this project, we use a Decision Tree classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on these features.


# Results
You'll see output showing the accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and visualizations of the Decision Tree. Additionally, the predictions for the new samples will be displayed.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
